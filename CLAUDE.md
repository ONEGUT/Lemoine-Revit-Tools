## Branch Workflow — Read Before Any Code Changes

### 1. Always Plan First

Before creating, checking out, or pushing to any branch, Claude must:

1. Write a plan `.md` file to the repo root (e.g., `plan-<description>.md`) covering what files will be changed, what will be added, and why.
2. Summarise the plan in a brief chat message.
3. Ask the user which branch to branch from.
4. **Wait for explicit approval from the user** before touching any branch or writing any code.

Approval means the user has responded with clear confirmation (e.g. "looks good", "go ahead", "yes"). Ambiguous responses are not approval — ask for clarification.

### 2. Branch Naming Convention

Branch names must be a short, lowercase kebab-case description of the change — nothing more.

Examples:
- `color-picker-swatches`
- `settings-tab-layout`
- `update-claude-md`

Rules:
- Lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only.
- 3–5 words max.
- Never push directly to `main` or `master`.

### 3. Branch Lifecycle

```
Plan (.md file + chat summary) → Ask which branch to base from → User Approval → Create Branch → Implement → Commit → Push → PR (if requested)
```

- One logical change per branch. Do not bundle unrelated fixes.
- Do not create a pull request unless the user explicitly asks for one.

### 4. Commit Messages

Use the imperative mood, present tense. One subject line, no trailing period.

```
Add recent-swatches row to color picker
Fix settings tab not rendering on first open
Refactor ILemoineTool to support async execute
```

## WPF UI Tasks

For any task that involves building, modifying, or debugging a WPF window or UserControl, invoke the `/revit-navisworks-ui` skill before writing any code. This applies even for small layout fixes.
